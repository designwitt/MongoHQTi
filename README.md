MongoHQTi
=========

#####Titanium module for connecting to MongoHQ.


This module is made specifically to use the MongoHQ REST api. You must have an account to use this module in any projects 
since it requires an API key. 

========
#####Current Status
Currently the module only supports GET methods for finding collections and documents. It does support all of the MongoHQ
parameter queries for both collection and documents. 

You can use only one database with this module at this time.

#####Examples
coming soon...
